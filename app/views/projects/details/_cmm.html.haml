  During the summer of 2007, I participated in the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Pennsylvania with the A T Charlie Johnson Group. While I was there, experiments on single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) field effect transistors (FET) functionalized with biomolecules were underway. These experiments demonstrated that these devices possess extraordinary chemical sensing and protein-binding detection applications. Functionalizing SWNT field effect transistors with single stranded DNA create devices with different electronic responses when exposed to various gases. 1, 2 Hence, this work shows promise in "electronic nose" and/ or "electronic tongue" applications. Moreover, other work within the group focuses the detection of proteins associated with human infection of the adenovirus. Infection by adenovirus is initiated by the binding of two proteins: CAR and Knob. This group was able to covalently functionalize CAR to SWNT FETs and use these devices to detect CAR-knob binding3. This demonstrates that the biological CAR- Knob can be immobilzed on the surface of a single walled carbon nanotube without losing its biological functionality.

  In addition to the experimental work, attention has also been brought to computational simulation methods. In particular, my work entailed performing a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on biological-molecule / nanotube systems in order to obtain a detailed atomic scale picture. More specifically, we investigated the process in which the coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR) protein is immobilized on SWNT. We conducted MD on an isolated, unbound CAR in aqueous solution, the protein covalently linked to the nanotube, and the protein non- specifically adsorbed to the nanotube. Furthermore, we also considered the possible linking sites of the protein, the conformational changes of the protein, the maximum and average height of the protein above the nanotube. The focus of this discussion will be on utilizing MD tools to verify existing experimental data as well as obtaining atomic resolution picture of the immobilization process between the CAR protein and a single walled carbon nanotube. We have found that CAR does not undergo major conformational changes upon SWNT binding and retains a low RMSD with respect to the unbound structure, reinforcing interpretations of recent experiments that suggest that CAR in complex with SWNT retains its biologically active form. We also report that four particuarly promising sites in which the protein can link to the nanotube. The focus of my work was utilizing MD tools to verify existing experimental data as well as obtaining atomic resolution picture of the immobilization process between the CAR protein and a single walled carbon nanotube.
