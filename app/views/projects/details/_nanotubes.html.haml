  During the academic year at Columbia, I worked in Professor Herman's group on the assembly of nano-electric devices. In particular, we were interested in creating single walled carbon nanotube devices using dielectrophoresis. At a high level this means that we used E-Fields to help align nanotubes. We used the property that nanotubes tend to allign with an external electric field in order to align the nanotubes along our devices.

  Our samples are typically two gold pads separated by either 3 or 10 nanometers. These pads are then contacted by electrodes using a probe station, where a potential difference is applied. This creates an electric field across the gap, whose value depends on the geometry of the gold. We have found that we can further enhance the field across the gap by placing 'floating posts' within the gaps. An example of one of our samples can be seen in the SEM image above. To read more about this work, see the publications section.

  Additionally, we are also investigating methods on improving electrical properties of the devices we create. So far, we have examined methods such as annealing the samples, electrodepositing palladium compounds on the samples, and shining UV light onto the samples. In my last semester, specifically, my main tasks involved working on a probe station electrodepositing a palladium compound onto the samples as well as performing before and after IV measurements on the nano structures. From these measurements, we can monitor the change in electrical resistance of the devices.

  During the summer of 2006, I participated in a National Science Foundation (NSF) program called Research Experience for Undergraduates in Professor Luzzi's Group. I worked on a project investigating factors that lead to the controlled growth of single walled carbon nanotubes. The concentration of the catalyst solution, the effect of fast-heating vs. slow-heating, and the direction of the gas flow relative to tube growth were studied in respect to nanotube densities (number of nanotubes per gap) and nanotube orientation in the growth of single walled nanotubes across 4 µm gaps via chemical vapor deposition. Samples were characterized through the use of scanning electron microscope imaging. In the growth of nanotubes formed from iron/molybdenum nanoparticles, it is observed that the fast growth method produced a higher nanotube density than does the slow growth method.

  We also reported that as concentration of the catalyst solution increases, the tendency of particles depositing on the substrate increases as well as the particles’ tendency to agglomerate. Thus, the appropriate solution must have a catalyst concentration high enough such that enough particles are deposited on the substrate, but low enough such that agglomeration that causes surface diffusion does not have a dominant effect. The catalyst solution concentration that produced the highest nanotube density yield was 10mg Fe(NO3)3: 100 mL 2-Proponal. Moreover, there is also a noticeable morphology difference between the deposited catalyst particles from fast heating growth and particles from slow heating growth. We believe this difference to be due to thermal fluctuations caused by the fast-heating method as well as grain coarsening in the slow-heating method.
